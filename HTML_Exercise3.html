        </dfn> In the web novel Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse, people are forced to 
        fight monsters and each other for coins, food, and—ultimately—survival. While mysterious 
        "Constellations" watch the unwilling participants for their own entertainment, one man emerges 
        as the protagonist: Yoo Joonghyuk, who repeatedly lives and dies in an endless struggle to close 
        the book on this indiscriminate torture. Kim Dokja has lived a challenging and action-packed life 
        through Joonghyuk for over a decade. While other readers abandoned the story early on, Kim Dokja has 
        remained its sole reader until the very last chapter. At that time, he receives a puzzling message from 
        the author, and the novel's inhumane world suddenly becomes reality. As the only person aware of what lies 
        ahead, Dokja realizes that he must utilize his omniscience to navigate the deadly scenarios and stay alive. 
        Dokja was never meant to play a main part, but in defiance of those who wish to spell his fate, he might just have 
        to take the lead in writing his own conclusion.</p>
